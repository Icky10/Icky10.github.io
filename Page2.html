            <p>Wedges have a special angled head which is meant to be used under special conditions in order to lob the ball. Wedges are mainly used in sand pits, the idea behind the angled head of the wedge is to cause the ball to fly high above any obstables.</p>

                Drivers/Woods have long shafts and a rounded head, they are used to hit the ball over a long distance. The Driver/Wood has the lightest head and a almost flat surface this allows them to be swung fast and hard which will make the ball fly as far as it can.
                They are mainly used at the tee off as the first shot in order to get the ball as close to the hole as possible.

            <p>The golf ball is the main star of the show as you would need to put the golf ball into the hole in order to win. Golf balls have dimples on their surface which help with it spinning while its in the air this makes the balls go further than a normal bal with no dimples.</p>
