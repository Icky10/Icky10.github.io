                Golf has a long history, while the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated.
                <br />
                One such theory say the game's progenitor is chuiwan(捶丸; "chui" means striking and "wan" means small ball) a Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries.
                A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled "The Autumn Banquet" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole.
                The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages.

                Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France. The Persian game chowkan is another possible ancient origin, albeit being more polo-like. 
                In addition, kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V, a year earlier.
